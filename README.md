# STINTSY-Order-of-Erin

Sentiment Analysis Project on Twitter Data.

## Set Up

> This project requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as its package manager. The remaining dependencies are handled by uv itself.

1. Simply clone the repository.
2. Run `uv sync` which should catch your environment up.
3. If your text editor does not support JupyterNotebooks run browser-based interface with `uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab`. No need to do this if you're using PyCharm or VSCode.
