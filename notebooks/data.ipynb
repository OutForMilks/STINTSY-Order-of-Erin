    "The Twitter Sentiments Dataset is a dataset that contains nearly 163k tweets from Twitter. The time period of when these were collected is unknown, but it was published to Mendeley Data on May 14, 2021 by Sherif Hussein of Mansoura University.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweets were extracted using the Twitter API, but the specifics of how the tweets were selected are unmentioned. The tweets are mostly English with a mix of some Hindi words for code-switching <u>(El-Demerdash., 2021)</u>. All of them seem to be talking about the political state of India. Most tweets mention Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister of India.\n",

In this context, the code-switching is done to appear more casual since the conversation is done via Twitter (now, X). "

    "The cleaning pipeline has four main functions. The first function is the `normalize` function, it normalizes the text input to ASCII-only characters (say, \"cómo estás\" becomes \"como estas\") and lowercases alphabetic symbols. The dataset contains Unicode characters (e.g., emojis and accented characters) which the function replaces to the empty string (`''`). Then, `rem_punctuation` removes the punctuation marks and special characters with the empty string. Then, `collapse_whitespace` collapses all whitespace characters to a single space. Formally, it is a transducer \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the domain of the corpus is Twitter, spam may become an issue by the vector representation step. Hence we employed some simple rule-based spam detection systems. The rule-based system removes words in the string that contains the same letter or substring thrice, consecutively, or strings like \"aaah\" or \"ahahahaha\" which is common expressions used in Twitter. These are filtered the regular expression below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{same\\_substring\\_twice} := (.^+)\\textbackslash1^+\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it also removes any string that has a length less than three, since these are either stopwords (that weren't detected in the stopword removal stage) or more spam, or strings like \"dd\", \"aa\", among others. Finally, we remove any string $s:\\text{String}$, with length $|s|$, if the condition below is true:\n",

    "This is an adaptive character diversity threshold for the string $s$. It calculates the diversity of characters in a string; if the string repeats the same character alot, we expect it to be unintelligible or useless, hence we remove it."

    "## **Vector Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the stemming and lemmatization steps, each entry can now be represented as a vector using a Bag of Words (BoW) model. We employ scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer`, which provides a ready-to-use implementation of BoW <u>(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **comparison of vectorization techniques:** Traditional vectorization techniques include BoW and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF weights each word based on its frequency in a document and its rarity across the corpus, reducing the impact of common words. BoW, in contrast, simply counts word occurrences without considering corpus-level frequency. In this project, BoW was chosen because stopwords were already removed during preprocessing, and the dataset is domain-specific <u>(Rani et al., 2022)</u>. In such datasets, frequent words are often meaningful domain keywords, so scaling them down (as TF-IDF would) could reduce the importance of these key terms in the feature representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tokenization:** Since the data cleaning and preprocessing stage is comprehensive, the tokenization step in the BoW model reduces to a simple word-boundary split operation. Each preprocessed entry in the DataFrame is split by spaces. For example, the entry `\"shri narendra modis\"` (entry: 42052) becomes `[\"shri\", \"narendra\", \"modis\"]`. By the end of tokenization, all entries are transformed into arrays of strings.\n",

This reduces noise and ensures the model focuses on meaningful terms."
