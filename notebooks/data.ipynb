    "The Twitter Sentiments Dataset is a dataset that contains nearly 163k tweets from Twitter. The time period of when these were collected is unknown, but it was published to Mendeley Data on May 14, 2021 by Sherif Hussein of Mansoura University.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweets were extracted using the Twitter API, but the specifics of how the tweets were selected are unmentioned. The tweets are mostly English with a mix of some Hindi words for code-switching<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). All of them seem to be talking about the political state of India. Most tweets mention Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister of India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tweet was assigned a label using TextBlob's sentiment analysis (El‑Demerdash, Hussein, & Zaki, 2021), which assigns labels automatically.\n",

    "## 2 data cleaning\n",
    "This section discusses the methodology for data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow a similar methodology for data cleaning presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning pipeline has four main functions. The first function is the `normalize` function, it normalizes the text input to ASCII-only characters (say, \"cómo estás\" becomes \"como estas\") and lowercases alphabetic symbols. The dataset contains Unicode characters (e.g., emojis and accented characters) which the function replaces to the empty string (`''`). Then, `rem_punctuation` removes the punctuation marks and special characters with the empty string. Then, `collapse_whitespace` collapses all whitespace characters to a single space. Formally, it is a transducer from $\\Box^+ \\mapsto \\Box$ where $\\Box$ is the whitespace character. Now, since the strings are cleaned at this point, the tokenization step reduces to a mere string split at word boundaries. Finally, with the tokenized string, we can do a final clean by removing the stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark on Stopwords.** For stop words removal, we refer to the English stopwords dataset defined in NLTK and Wolfram Mathematica [2,3]. However, since the task is sentiment analysis, words that invoke polarity, intensification, and negation are important. Words like \"not\" and \"okay\" are commonly included as stopwords. Therefore, the stopwords from [2,3] are manually adjusted to only include stopwords that invoke neutrality, examples are \"after\", \"when\", and \"you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark on Potential Spam.** Since the domain of the corpus is Twitter, spam may become an issue by the vector representation step. Hence we employed some simple rule-based spam detection systems.\n",

    "## Vector Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "After to stemming and lemmatization steps, we can now represent each each entry to its vector representation from a Bag of Words (BoW) model. We use scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` which is an ready-to-use implementation of the BoW model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Related Literature and Vectorization Techniques.** Traditional vectorization techniques include BoW and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF weights each word based on its frequency in a document and how rare it is across the corpus, reducing the impact of common words. BoW, in contrast, simply counts word occurrences without considering corpus-level frequency. In this project, BoW was chosen because stopwords were already removed during preprocessing, and the dataset is domain-specific [3]. In such datasets, frequent words are often meaningful domain keywords, so scaling them down (as TF-IDF would) could reduce the importance of these key terms in the feature representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting vector has 162,969 rows which is the number of entries in the dataset (with `NaN` entries removed), and 101,284 which is the number of unique words in the dataset.\n",
