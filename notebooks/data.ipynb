    "The Twitter Sentiments Dataset is a dataset that contains nearly 163k tweets from Twitter. The time period of when these were collected is unknown, but it was published to Mendeley Data on May 14, 2021 by Sherif Hussein of Mansoura University.\n",

The tweets are mostly English with a mix of some Hindi words for code-switching<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). All of them seem to be talking about the political state of India. Most tweets mention Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister of India.\n",

    "We follow a similar methodology for data cleaning presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning pipeline has four main functions. The first function is the `normalize` function, it normalizes the text input to ASCII-only characters (say, \"cómo estás\" becomes \"como estas\") and lowercases alphabetic symbols. The dataset contains Unicode characters (e.g., emojis and accented characters) which the function replaces to the empty string (`''`). Then, `rem_punctuation` removes the punctuation marks and special characters with the empty string. Then, `collapse_whitespace` collapses all whitespace characters to a single space. Formally, it is a transducer from $\\Box^+ \\mapsto \\Box$ where $\\Box$ is the whitespace character. Now, since the strings are cleaned at this point, the tokenization step reduces to a mere string split at word boundaries. Finally, with the tokenized string, we can do a final clean by removing the stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "For stop words removal, we refer to the English stopwords dataset defined in NLTK and Wolfram Mathematica [2,3].\n",

    "After to stemming and lemmatization steps, we can now represent each each entry to its vector representation from a Bag of Words (BoW) model. We use scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` which is an ready-to-use implementation of the BoW model.\n",

    "**Related Literature and Vectorization Techniques.** Traditional vectorization techniques include BoW and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF weights each word based on its frequency in a document and how rare it is across the corpus, reducing the impact of common words. BoW, in contrast, simply counts word occurrences without considering corpus-level frequency. In this project, BoW was chosen because stopwords were already removed during preprocessing, and the dataset is domain-specific [3]. In such datasets, frequent words are often meaningful domain keywords, so scaling them down (as TF-IDF would) could reduce the importance of these key terms in the feature representation.\n",
