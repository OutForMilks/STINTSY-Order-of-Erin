    "**Motivation**: Every minute, social media users generate a large influx of textual data on live events. Performing sentiment analysis on this data provides a real-time view of public perception, enabling quick insights into the general population’s opinions and reactions.\n",

    "### **Dataset Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Twitter Sentiments Dataset is a dataset that contains nearly 163k tweets from Twitter. The time period of when these were collected is unknown, but it was published to Mendeley Data on May 14, 2021 by Sherif Hussein of Mansoura University.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweets were extracted using the Twitter API, but the specifics of how the tweets were selected are unmentioned. The tweets are mostly English with a mix of some Hindi words for code-switching<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). All of them seem to be talking about the political state of India. Most tweets mention Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister of India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tweet was assigned a label using TextBlob's sentiment analysis (El‑Demerdash, Hussein, & Zaki, 2021), which assigns labels automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "What each row and column represents: `each row represents one tweet.`\n",
    "Number of observations: `162,980`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a>1. [^](#cite_ref-1) Code-switching is the practice of alternating between two languages $L_1$ (the native language) and $L_2$ (the source language) in a conversation. In this context, the code-switching is done to appear more casual since the conversation is done via Twitter (now, X). "
